# Shopping-cart-AWS
Here I took my shopping cart app and refactored it to build a static website and deployed it to AWS S3 buckets. This was a week 20 assignment.
 
#### Installation:
 
You would have to get your own AWS account and set up a bucket to put the contents of the Build folder in you AWS bucket.
 
#### Usage:
 
Keep track of stock and cost of items.
 
#### Support: 
 
Currently, I need support to get it working.
 
#### Roadmap: 
Plan on getting it to work.
 
#### License information:
